Hey! If you're seeing this, you are in the right place. 

Make sure you're connecting to this folder in Visual Studio Code.

Once  you've connected, feel free to run the test.py file that should pop up all of the python packages you've installed for your virtual environment!
We are almost ready to get started!!

Post on the discord if you have any questions.
